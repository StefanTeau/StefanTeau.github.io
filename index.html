				<h3>What is a Cryptocurrency?</h3>

				<p>It is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the way units of its currency are created and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank using blockchain technology.</p>
				
	                        <h3>What is blockchain technology?</h3>

				<p>Currently, most people use a trusted middleman such as a bank to make a transaction. But blockchain allows consumers and suppliers to connect directly, removing the need for a third party.

Using cryptography to keep exchanges secure, blockchain provides a decentralized database, or “digital ledger”, of transactions that everyone on the network can see. This network is essentially a chain of computers that must all approve an exchange before it can be verified and recorded.
